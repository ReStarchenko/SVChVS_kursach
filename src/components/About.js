            <h3>About project</h3>
            <p>This project was designed with the idea of fast and easy access to an online editor of  your family tree. Some years ago creating a family tree was able onlyby paying money to national archives and it took nearly forever to get your family tree. Nowadays it's much easier.</p>

            <h3>The beginning</h3>
            <p>Starting date of the project is November 13th 2022. Due to busyness of the only designer at the end of the semester, free time to spend on the project was limitted and this lead to delay.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>After remaking project two times from scratch it was finally completed at the end of March 2023.</p>
